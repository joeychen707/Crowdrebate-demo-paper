\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

We present the Crowdrebate platform, which collects requests from users, groups requests into a set of orders to get more rebates and delivers products to different receivers in an order. Crowdrebate is equipped with the techniques including the crowdrebate algorithm grouping orders for maximum rebates, web crawling, items recommendation, and data visualization. We also introduce the sketch of system architecture and demonstrate scenarios via several case analyses.
