With the flourishing development of e-commerce platforms, there are various promotion operations, such as offering coupons with a high threshold to stimulate customers to buy more products all at once. Nevertheless, customers always find that the price of the products they intend to order is below the coupons or free delivery service threshold. In order to enjoy these instant benefits, they often need to spend a lot of time looking for others with the same need to place an order together.

In order to address the above issues, we develop a Crowdrebate platform that collects users' requests and groups them into a set of orders qualifying to use the suitable coupons by the Crowdrebate algorithm, after that, Crowdrebate delivers products to different receivers in an order, aiming at saving users' shopping time and helping users get more rebate from online promotions. Crowdrebate is equipped with several novel techniques, including the Crowdrebate algorithm grouping orders for maximum instant rebates, web crawling, items recommendation, and data visualization. We introduce the sketch of the system architecture of Crowdrebate and demonstrate various scenarios via several case analyses.
