With the rapid development of e-commerce platforms, there are various promotion operations, such as offering coupons with a high threshold to stimulate customers to buy more products all at once. Nevertheless, customers always find that the price of the products they intend to order is below the coupons or delivery service threshold. They will spend lots of time looking for others with the same need to place an order together to enjoy more instant benefits. These complex processes are unreliable and time-consuming for consumers.

In this demo, we will present the Crowdrebate platform, which collects requests from users, groups requests into a set of orders to get more rebates and delivers products to different receivers in an order. Crowdrebate is equipped with the techniques including the crowdrebate algorithm grouping orders for maximum rebates, web crawling, items recommendation, and data visualization. 
We introduce the sketch of system architecture and demonstrate various scenarios via several case analyses.
